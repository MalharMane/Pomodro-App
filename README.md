## : Pomodoro - A Time Management Technique .

* This popular time management method asks you to alternate pomodoros — focused work sessions — with frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue.
* It helps you divide larger, more time-consuming tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. To use the Pomodoro Technique in the traditional way, you set a timer and complete focused, high-effort work for 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes are up, you take a 5-minute break. This is known as a single Pomodoro
